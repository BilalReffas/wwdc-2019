 ## The Game
 Find the correct word. The programm is randomly picking an word that is hard to learn for kids with dyslexia.
 The game shows you how many letters the word has. If the letter is correct than it appears at it¬¥s posit√≠on.
 If a word contains one letter twice, the letter will apeare at too positions.
 You can play the game in dylexia mode or in "normal" mode. The dyslexia mode make is a bit tricker üòÅ.
 In this mode you need to make the same mistakes witch a person with dyslexia makes (don¬¥t worry only the similar letter mistake).
 
 The programm is counting how many mistakes you make. So you can compare it each time, or with friends.
 
 - Note:
 Your task is to show the board. And play the game.
