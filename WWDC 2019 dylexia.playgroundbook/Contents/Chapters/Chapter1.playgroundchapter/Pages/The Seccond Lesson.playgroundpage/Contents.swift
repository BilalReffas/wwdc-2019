 About dyslexia:
 
 Dyslexia is a problem which have 20% of all people, I´m one of them. the biggest problems are in school. The most common problem is that the people with dyslexia spell like they hear the words, but you know that it is often not the case. People with this problem can get in a lot of trouble in jobs or in school. I want to show you how hard it can be to bead dylexia.
 
 I am focusing on 2 problem:
 - the problem of similar letters (d - b,q - p,n - m, e - i, k - g)
 - ignoreing letters

 most kids already have some experience with writing some letter. But kids with dyslexia often don´t know which letter is which.
 
 The teacher wants that you draw an A.

 After days of figuring out how to draw letters yourself, the teacher wants to look at it.
 Your are really nervous because it is your first time the teacher wants to see your work.
 As a kid with dyslexia you make more mistakes than enyone else in the class.
 
 - Note:
 Your task is now to add the teacher to the Sceen. Then draw the A again.
